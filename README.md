# WebGL sandbox
This repo is a playground project of WebGL works. Random examples and experiments go here.

# Initial setup

```
$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d && docker-compose exec app bash
$ yarn run nuxt
```

And then it will start listening to http://0.0.0.0:4000. You can change the port and host as you like by editting nuxt.config.js or in other ways.
